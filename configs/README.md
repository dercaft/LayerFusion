# Configurations


The purpose of this python folder is to easily retrieve predefined settings
for certain tests that need to be run.

## Seperating out Model and Application Configurations

To make it easier in the long run I'm splitting the default configurations into
two because the number of configuration is growing. The easiest distinction to make is
between model-specific configs, and task-specific configs, and hence that is what
I will do now.
